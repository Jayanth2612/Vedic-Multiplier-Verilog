# Vedic Multiplier with Matrix Multiplication

This project implements **Vedic Multipliers** of increasing bit sizes (2-bit to 32-bit) using the **Urdhva Tiryakbhyam Sutra** from Vedic mathematics. The design has been extended to matrix multiplication with different addition techniques:  
- **Normal assignment-based addition**  
- **Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA)**  
- **Ripple Carry Adder (RCA)**  

The implementation is done in **Verilog HDL** and verified with a testbench for the 32-bit Vedic multiplier.
